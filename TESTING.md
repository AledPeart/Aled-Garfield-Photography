# Aled Garfield Photography - Testing 

[README.md](https://github.com/AledPeart/MS1-Aled-Garfield-Photography/blob/master/README.md)

I have tested my site to ensure that it achieves the intended aims of the owner and the expectations of the users by meeting the user stories detailed in the [README.md](https://github.com/AledPeart/MS1-Aled-Garfield-Photography/blob/master/README.md). I have also manually tested my site across a number of different devices and browsers to ensure that the design, layout and functionality respond as intended. In addition the validity of my HTML and CSS have been checked using the [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Finally I have used [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in Chrome DevTools to test the accessibility and performance of my site. The specific tests and results are detailed below:

## Responsiveness 

I have tested my site across 5 screen widths in order to best replicate the breadth of modern viewing devices, in order to ensure that the site responds and performs as expected. These are also the Bootstrap ‘breakpoints’ adhered to when building the website:

* Extra Small 	<576px  
* Small		576-768px  
* Medium		768-992px  
* Large		992-1200px  
* Extra Large	>1200px  

These tests were carried out using Chrome DevTools to adjust the screen size and view the website at the designated screen widths.

## Cross-Browser Testing

To further ensure my site was functioning as expected I have tested it across different browsers at different device sizes. The other browsers I have tested are Safari and Firefox, which combined with Chrome, account for almost 90% of browser usage (source: (www.browserstack.com) I tested the site on these browsers, on physical devices, which I have access to, namely:

*	A large screen desktop
*	Laptop
*	Tablet
*	Mobile device

I followed the same testing criterias that I used for my Manual Testing, but I have not detailed the results of the tests in full here as I feel it would prove too lengthy for it’s intended purpose. I have however summarised the results and the issues encountered below:

### Large Screen Desktop

__Firefox__ – No issues found   
__Safari__ – No issues found 

### Laptop

__Firefox__ – No issues found    
__Safari__ – 3 portfolio images on the homepage appeared vertically stretched

### Tablet 

__Firefox__ – No issues found   
__Safari__ - 3 portfolio images on the homepage appeared vertically stretched

### Mobile 

__Firefox__ – No issues found  
__Safari__ – I asked a friend who has an  I-phone to go through the site for me, he also reported that the 3 portfolio images on the homepage appeared vertically stretched.


## HTML and CSS Validation

While developing I have regularly validated my HTML and CSS using [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).  
Errors and Warnings that were highlighted to me that I addressed during the project were:
* Image filenames containing capitals
* Missing closing </div> tags
* __section__ tags that did not have an __h1__ or an __h2__ as a direct child
* Missing __:__ and __}__ in my css file

At the time of submission the results are showing no errors (see screenshots below)

## Lighthouse Testing

I have used [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in Chrome DevTools to test the accessibility and performance of my site. The initial test gave me the following results:   

![Lighthouse screenshot](https://github.com/AledPeart/MS1-Aled-Garfield-Photography/blob/master/assets/images/lighthouse-test-pre.jpg)   

I implemented the following recommendations made in the report:
1. Changing the colour of the text in the testimonial section of the homepage to increase the contrast and improve accessibility.
2. Amending the sub-heading on the introduction section on the homepage from a __h3__ to a __h2__ to improve the semantics of my HTML.
3. Adding __rel="noopener"__ to all external links across the site to reduce the site's  vulnerability.
4. Adding a __meta description__ tag to the __<head>__ element of each page to improve my SEO.

Following these changes I re-ran the Lighthouse tests and the improved scores can be seen below   

![Lighthouse screenshot](https://github.com/AledPeart/MS1-Aled-Garfield-Photography/blob/master/assets/images/lighthouse-test-post.jpg)

## Test Results and Bugs

The majority of the errors and bugs I came across are noted below and were addressed during the development phase. The main issue I discovered as a result of my testing was that some of the images on the home page were being stretched out (see no 4. below)

__1. Content overflowing the parent container on the homepage intro section.__   
![bug screenshot 1](https://github.com/AledPeart/MS1-Aled-Garfield-Photography/blob/master/assets/images/bug1.jpg)   
The above issue was being caused by the word 'photography' which at the given font size was too wide to fit the parent container. I was advised by my mentor to either reduce the font size or to write a media query to correct the issue. A large font size was integral to the design, so on larger screens this was maintained, and for smaller screens I wrote the following media query to reduce the font size when the screen falls below 400px.

 ```css
@media screen and (max-width: 400px) {
    .intro-headline h1 {
        font-size: 45px;
    }
} 
```
__2. Gallery images not displaying properly on the portfolio page.__ The aim on this page was to achieve a clean, tiled gallery, with the images nicely aligned and the margins consistent, to give the user a pleasing viewing experience.  I could not get the images to align properly and the margins were not equally spaced, after some time trying to figure this out I realised that the solution here was to re-size the images (portrait and landscape) in Photoshop to the exact same widths. This gave me the result I was aiming for.

__3. Horizontal page scroll and Footer margin issues.__    
![bug screenshot 3](https://github.com/AledPeart/MS1-Aled-Garfield-Photography/blob/master/assets/images/bug3.jpg)    
I was getting a lot of horizontal movement on my site, particularly at smaller screen sizes. The contents would jump left and right, and was clearly not right. On a separate but seemingly linked issue, my footer was displaying a right hand margin which should not have been there. I spent a lot of time investigating this issue on DevTools, but as much as I tried I could not isolate what was causing it. I spoke to my mentor, who confirmed that there was nothing apparent or obvious causing the issue. In the end I found somebody else with a very similar issue on a post in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23768152/using-container-fluid-within-bootstrap-cause-horizontal-scrollbar) There were a number of suggestions, but one which worked on my site was suggested by @Viktor L which was to set the left and right margins for all rows to 0:

```css
.row {
  margin-left: 0;
  margin-right: 0;
}
```
__4. Images stretching horizontally on iphone/ipad.__   
![bug screenshot 4](https://github.com/AledPeart/MS1-Aled-Garfield-Photography/blob/master/assets/images/bug4.jpg)   
When my site was viewed in safari on an ipad and an iphone, the images in the portfolio section of the homepage appeared to be stretching out vertically. When testing in Chrome DevTools and on physical devices using the Chrome browser the issue did not appear, and the images scaled to fit the screen appropriately. I tried to fix the issue using Bootstrap's 'image-fluid' class. I was unable to resolve this by myself, but after some investigating I found a solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57516373/image-stretching-in-flexbox-in-safari). Credit to @Michael_B for the following snippet which addressed the issue:

```
portfolio-image-div {
    align-items: flex-start;
}
```
According to users on that thread, this is a common bug whereby Safari will stretch the image to it's full height rather than to the confines of the parent container.

__5. Footer text being pushed into the margin.__ 
At medium screen resolutions the 'copyright' footer text was being pushed into the bottom left of the screen, causing some of it to be lost.

![bug screenshot 5](https://github.com/AledPeart/MS1-Aled-Garfield-Photography/blob/master/assets/images/bug5.jpg)   

I was able to resolve this issue by writing the following media query:
```
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    .copyright-footer-text {
        margin-left: 100px;
        margin-bottom: 50px;
    }
}
```
This ensured that at screen sizes above 768px and additional left an bottom margin was applied to the footer text.
