# Aled Garfield Photography

Aled Garfield Photography is a small independent photography business specialising in wedding and family portrait photography. The purpose of this project is to build a new static frontend website for the business, in order to showcase the photographers work, generate customer enquiries and thereby facilitate further growth.

## About the Business

I established Aled Garfield Photography in 2012, and it has grown steadily since. The business specializes in wedding and family portrait photography. The photographic style is very laid back and informal and the aim is to capture people naturally in a ‘documentary’ style rather than in a posed or forced fashion. This is key to the business’ brand and the aim is to provide a very relaxed and unique experience to customers on their wedding day or at their portrait session. 
As the sole photographer and therefore the ‘face’ of the business, the amount of work I can take on is limited and so generating enquiries from the right type of customers whose vision and expectations align with what I can offer them, is more important than generating a high volume of enquiries. This approach leads to an increased level of customer satisfaction, and a greater chance of referrals and repeat business, which for a small enterprise is hugely important. The role of a new website will be crucial in achieving these aims. The style of photography and brand ethos will be communicated to users through the use of strong showcase images and reinforced throughout the site using clean simple design, elegant, muted color palettes and consistent styling. Key information on pricing, style and ethos will be clearly communicated in text, while the layout will provide a positive user experience and guide users through the key areas of the website. Ultimately users whose needs are met by what is on offer will be lead to make contact through the websites contact form.

## Layout/Structure/Features

All pages will have the same basic structure, namely a navigation bar at the top of each page, and a footer area at the bottom of each page. 

The navigation bar will be clean, clear and simple, providing users with a means to navigate quickly between the different pages of the site, it will also display the businesses’ brand logo, which will link back to the homepage. It will be fully responsive and will reduce to a ‘hamburger’ dropdown menu on smaller devices (see wireframes)

The footer area will contain copyright information, links to social media pages and a button-link so that users can easily return to the top of the page, and to the main site navigation links. The footer area on each page will also contain a ‘As featured on’ section, which will have badges that link to popular wedding blogs that have featured the photographers work.  

The landing/home page will be split into a series of clearly defined sections that the user can scroll through, which will highlight the features of the site, a kind of ‘visual menu’ from which the user can choose to explore the site.

The first thing users will see is a full-width image just below the page header, which encapsulates the ethos of the business’ brand, and instantly familiarises users with the style and quality of the photography. Below the images will be some headline text and a paragraph which introduces the user to the site. Underneath this will be a portfolio section showing 3 further images and a link to the 'portfolio' page. This will be followed by a short 'about me' section and link so that users can learn more. (*either an expanding link or a link into a separate page if necessary*). This will be followed by a testimonial section, containing some quotes from past customers. Finally at the bottom of the landing page there will be a contact me section which will link to the 'contact' page, where users can complete a contact form in order to make contact with the photographer.

The pages, linked from the navigation bar and from the main page where applicable will be:

* About Me – A page containing some images and bio of the photographer and some more detail on the photographic style offered.

* Gallery/Portfolio – a page with a series of images laid out in a tiled gallery to showcase the photographers work.

* Contact Page – a contact form where users can get in touch to enquire about availability
